# Prompt History Record: Todo Advanced Features Tasks

## User Input

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive task list for implementing the Advanced Intelligent Features for the Todo App, organized into 6 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (project structure creation)
- Phase 2: Foundational (blocking prerequisites)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Recurring Tasks (P1 priority - MVP)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Due Dates & Reminders (P2 priority)
- Phase 5: Integration & CLI Enhancement
- Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

The tasks are organized by user story priority and include proper dependencies, parallel execution opportunities, and validation checkpoints. Each task is clearly identified with its ID, priority opportunities (P), and user story association (US1, US2). The tasks cover all aspects of the advanced features: recurring tasks with daily/weekly/monthly patterns and due date management with overdue status detection.

## Outcome

The task list is complete and ready for implementation. It follows the specification requirements and maintains existing functionality while adding the advanced level features.

## Evaluation

The tasks successfully break down the advanced feature implementation into manageable, traceable units that follow the spec requirements and maintain the existing basic and intermediate functionality while adding recurring tasks and due date management capabilities.
