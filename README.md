📝 Todo In-Memory Python Console App – Phase I

Created by: Muhammad Farman 👨‍💻
Status: ✅ Phase I Complete | 🚀 Future Phases Planned

Welcome to the Todo App, a spec-driven Python console application built entirely using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.
This project demonstrates a clean code, agentic development workflow, and serves as the foundation for advanced todo applications in the future.

🎯 Project Objective

Build a command-line todo application with in-memory storage that:

Follows spec-driven development

Implements core todo features

Uses Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus workflow:

📝 Write spec

🗂 Generate plan

⚡ Break into tasks

🤖 Implement via Claude Code

💡 No manual coding was done – fully automated spec-driven development.

🚀 Phase I – Features Implemented (Basic Level)

This phase satisfies all Phase I requirements:

Feature	Description	Status
Add Task 🆕	Create new todo items and store them in memory	✅ Completed
Delete Task ❌	Remove tasks from the list	✅ Completed
Update Task ✏️	Modify existing task details	✅ Completed
View Task List 📋	Display all tasks with their status	✅ Completed
Mark as Complete ✅	Toggle task completion status	✅ Completed

🌟 All features implemented according to clean code principles and project specs.

🛠 Technology Stack

Python 3.13+ 🐍

Claude Code 🤖 (automated code generation)

Spec-Kit Plus 📚 (specification-driven development)

⚙️ Installation

Clone or download this repository 📥

Navigate to the project root directory

Ensure Python 3.13+ is installed on your system 🐍

Verify Python version:

python --version

▶️ Usage

Run the Todo application from the project root:

python -m src.todo_app.main


🖥️ Follow the console prompts to:

➕ Add tasks

✏️ Update tasks

❌ Delete tasks

📋 View all tasks

✅ Mark tasks as complete

💡 Note:
All tasks are stored in memory only.
No database or external storage is used in Phase I.

🤖 Claude Code Integration

Fully implemented via Claude Code with Spec-Kit Plus

Task breakdowns, iterations, and automated coding are documented in CLAUDE.md

Demonstrates an agentic development workflow for reproducibility

📜 Project Highlights

✅ Full Phase I requirements implemented

✅ Clean, maintainable Python code

✅ Spec-driven development for reproducibility

✅ Console-based MVP for todo management

🔮 Future Phases

This project will evolve through the following phases:

Phase	Name	Description
Phase I	In-Memory Python Console App	✅ Complete
Phase II	Full-Stack Web Application	🌐 Persistent storage & web UI
Phase III	AI-Powered Todo Chatbot	🤖 AI-driven task interaction
Phase IV	Local Kubernetes Deployment	☸️ Local container orchestration
Phase V	Advanced Cloud Deployment	☁️ Scalable cloud infrastructure

🏗 Each phase will be developed step-by-step using the same spec-driven workflow.
